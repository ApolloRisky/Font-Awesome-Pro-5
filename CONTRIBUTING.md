# Contributing to Font Awesome Pro


## Reporting Issues & Submitting Ideas/Requests
Found a problem with Font Awesome Pro? Want to see a specific icon revised/added? Feel free to submit an issue on the GitHub project. But please keep the following in mind:

1. Please be nice. Font Awesome is a happy place.
2. Please [search](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome-Pro/search?type=Issues) to see if your issue was already reported. If it was, join in on the conversation or upvote that issue.
3. Before opening any issue, please read the generic [issue guidelines](https://github.com/necolas/issue-guidelines), by Nicolas Gallagher.
4. After doing everything above, feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome-Pro/issues/new).

### Icon Requests + Suggestions
New icons mostly start as requests by the [Font Awesome Pro community on GitHub](../../issues). Want to request a new icon or category? Here are some things to keep in mind:

1. Please be nice. Font Awesome is a happy place.
3. Please [search](../../search?type=Issues) to see if your icon or category request already exists. If a request is found, please add a üëç reaction to that one.

#### Requesting Individual Icons
1. Please do not request comprehensive sets of icons related to a very specific field.
2. Please make requests for single icons, unless you are suggesting an icon category (see below).
3. Please and thank you if you include the following:
  - Title your [new issue](../../issues/new?title=Icon%20Request:%20icon-) `Icon request: icon-name` (e.g., `Icon request: icon-car`).
  - Include a few use cases for your requested icon. How do you plan on using it?
  - Attach a single color image or two that represent the idea you're going for.
  - Request concrete objects: it's harder to make an icon to represent happiness, it's easier to make a smiley face. ‚ò∫

#### Requesting Icon Categories
1. Include a few examples of icons or subjects to be covered in the category. How do you plan on using it?
2. Please and thank you if you include the following:
  - Title your [new issue](../../issues/new?title=Category%20Request:%20) `Category request: Category Name` (e.g., `Icon request: Desserts`).

Please note: at the moment **we are not accepting external icon contributions**. If you'd like us to design and add a specific icon, you can make a request via the steps above. Feel free to include inspiration (including your own sketches/designs) along with the request.

### Reporting Security Issues
Please do not report security issues in public. Please email hello@fontawesome.com.
